*set observations to 1000
set obs 1000

*generate random variables
gen x1 = rnormal()
gen x2 = rnormal()
gen e1 = rnormal()

*generate variable y as a function of all previous variables
gen y = 1 + 1*x1 - 1*x2 + 1*e1

*estimate the relationship between x1, x2 and y assuming e is observable
regress y x1 x2 e1

*estimate the relationship between x1, x2 and y assuming e is unobservable
regress y x1 x2

*a non-linear, probit, example
*generate latent score, yhat
gen ystar = 1 + 1*x1 - 1*x2 + 1*e1

*generate observed value of y as a function of yhat
gen ybinary = 1 if ystar > 0
replace ybinary = 0 if ystar <= 0

*tabulate yhat
tab ybinary

*regress ybinary against x1 and x2 using a probit model
probit ybinary x1 x2
